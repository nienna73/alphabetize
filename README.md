# alphabetize README

Alphabetizes your selection of text or code treating each line as its own item to be alphabetized. Recognizes comments preprended with `#` or `//` and keeps them above the line they were above when you started. Sometimes works on nested items.

## Features

The extension really just has the one feature: alphabetize items. It's likely not 100% so please reach out if there's anything I can fix. Here's an example of how it works with a basic list of animals containing nested objects:

## Requirements

I genuinely don't think there are any. Please tell me if I'm wrong.

## Known Issues

Sometimes nested items aren't sorted properly. Please just select that section again and rerun the command on that chunk of code. All other known issues have current workarounds.

## Release Notes

This is the first release, everything is new!

**Enjoy!**
